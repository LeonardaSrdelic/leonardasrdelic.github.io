## Relevant Projects

**LIFT: Leveraging Inter-Firm Transactions, OECD**
*Using VAT transaction data between firms for policy analysis*

OECD member countries are increasingly interested in policies that support firms in responding to disruptions caused by climate change, the digital transition, or shocks in foreign supply chains. Firms are increasingly fragmenting their production processes into multiple stages carried out by different domestic or foreign firms. This can amplify potential shocks and complicate the design of business support measures‚Äîespecially their targeting‚Äîas the risk of spillovers grows with stronger inter-firm linkages.

The project aims to (1) support the monitoring of supply shocks across domestic production networks and uncover hidden interdependencies, and (2) leverage transaction data to understand spillover effects in the design of industrial policies.
