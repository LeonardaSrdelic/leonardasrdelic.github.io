## Welcome to My Personal Webpage

### About Me
I am passionate about exploring, whether it's through hiking in nature or diving into data and research.

My professional work focuses on analysing climate change mitigation and adaptation policies. This includes the European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS 1 and 2), the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), environmental taxes, redistribution policies, EU funding mechanisms, and investments in climate-resilient infrastructure and technologies.

I develop top-down climate stress tests that evaluate how physical and transition climate risks affect public financesâ€”particularly the impacts of natural disasters on public debt and other macro-fiscal variables.

Additionally, I conduct bottom-up stress tests based on geospatial data sourced from Copernicus and IPCC WG1. By linking these datasets with georeferenced asset and portfolio distributions, I assess their exposure to climate-related risks. I also calculate carbon footprints and create various econometric and analytical models in climate economics and fiscal policy.
